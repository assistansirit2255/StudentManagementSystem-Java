**📘 Student Management System (Java)**

A Java-based console application that demonstrates Exception Handling, Custom Exceptions, Multithreading, Wrapper Classes, and OOP Concepts.
The program collects student details, validates user input, simulates a loading process using threads, and displays the student’s academic details along with an automatically calculated grade.

🚀 Features

✔ Exception Handling

Validates empty fields

Validates marks range (0–100)

Uses try-catch-finally

Implements custom exception: StudentNotFoundException

✔ Multithreading

Uses a separate Loader thread

Simulates a loading animation (Loading.....)

Demonstrates thread creation and joining

✔ Wrapper Classes

Uses Integer and Double with autoboxing

Demonstrates conversion from primitives to wrapper objects

✔ Student Module

Add student details

Validate input

Display full student profile

Generate grade based on marks
